# Progress Report App

This App was developped for a client to track and disply the development of a Sefer Torah being written in another country.

I created a data file constauining an array of objects. Each object is designated to one ofn the 245 amudim of a Sefer Torah. 

I created a generic display card component for each amud which pulls the unique data info from the array for each amud. Using the .map function I have all the amudim being displayed on the page,as they are finished in real life so that the buyer can see where the project is holding.
