# Progress Report App

This App was developped for a client to track and disply the development of a Sefer Torah being written in another country.

I created a data file constauining an array of objects. Each object is designated to one ofn the 245 amudim of a Sefer Torah. 

I created a generic display card component for each amud which pulls the unique data info from the array for each amud. Using the .map function I have all the amudim being displayed on the page. After each one is completed they are updated in the data file. This way the buyer can see where the project is holding.
